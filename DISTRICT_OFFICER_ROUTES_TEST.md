## üêõ Potential Issues Fixed

### Issue 1: Status Case Sensitivity
**Problem**: Database stores status as `IN_PROGRESS` (uppercase) but frontend checks for `in_progress` (lowercase)

**Solution**: Updated frontend to check for both cases:
```typescript
{(complaint.status === 'in_progress' || 
  complaint.status === 'IN_PROGRESS' ||
  complaint.status === 'acknowledged') && (
  // Show buttons
)}
```

### Issue 2: Button Visibility Logic
**Problem**: Buttons were hidden due to tab-based logic

**Solution**: Changed to status-based logic:
- `submitted` ‚Üí Show Acknowledge button
- `in_progress` or `acknowledged` ‚Üí Show Proof/Resolve/Notify buttons
- `resolved` ‚Üí Show verification message
