}
```

**What Happens:**

  ],
  "markAsResolved": true
}
```

**Requirements:**

formData.append('photos', file1);
formData.append('photos', file2);
// ... up to 10 photos

fetch('/api/officer/complaints/[id]/upload-proof-photos', {
  method: 'POST',
  headers: {
    'Authorization': `Bearer ${token}`
  },
  body: formData
});
```

**Specifications:**
- Maximum 10 photos per upload

## ‚ö†Ô∏è Important Notes

1. **Verification Required:** When you mark a complaint as resolved, it goes to the State Level Officer for verification and final closure.

2. **Photo Evidence:** For resolved complaints, proof photos are mandatory. This ensures transparency and accountability.

3. **Status Flow:**
   ```
   SUBMITTED ‚Üí ACKNOWLEDGED ‚Üí IN_PROGRESS ‚Üí RESOLVED ‚Üí CLOSED
                    ‚Üì              ‚Üì              ‚Üì
              (by District)  (by District)  (by State)
   ```

4. **Cannot Edit After Resolution:** Once marked as resolved, you cannot modify the complaint. Contact the State Officer if corrections are needed.

5. **Performance Tracking:** Your work completion rate, average resolution time, and deadline adherence are tracked and visible to supervisors.

## üîê API Authentication

All endpoints require Bearer token authentication:

```
Authorization: Bearer <your-jwt-token>
```

---

## üìû Support

If you encounter issues:
1. Check your internet connection
2. Verify you have the correct permissions
3. Contact your State Level Officer
4. For technical issues, contact system administrator

---

```javascript
// 1. Acknowledge complaint
await fetch('/api/officer/complaints/123/acknowledge', {
  method: 'POST',

    'Authorization': 'Bearer <token>',
    'Content-Type': 'application/json'
  },
  body: JSON.stringify({
    message: 'Acknowledged and assigned team'
  })
});

// 2. Upload photos
const formData = new FormData();
formData.append('photos', photoFile1);
formData.append('photos', photoFile2);

const uploadRes = await fetch('/api/officer/complaints/123/upload-proof-photos', {
  method: 'POST',
  headers: { 'Authorization': 'Bearer <token>' },
  body: formData
});

const { urls } = await uploadRes.json();

// 3. Submit proof and resolve
await fetch('/api/officer/complaints/123/submit-proof', {
  method: 'POST',
  headers: {
    'Authorization': 'Bearer <token>',
