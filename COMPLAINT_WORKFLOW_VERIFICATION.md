## Workflow Stages

- **Optional**: Notify citizen upon closure

### 7. Final Closure
- **Who**: State Officer (only)
- **Status**: `CLOSED`
- **Action**: State officer closes complaint and optionally notifies citizen
- **Notification**: State officer can send final notification to citizen

## Authorization Matrix

| Action | District Officer | State Officer |
|--------|------------------|---------------|
| Acknowledge Complaint | ‚úÖ (only assigned complaints) | ‚ùå |
| Submit Proof of Work | ‚úÖ (while in progress) | ‚ùå |
| Mark as Resolved | ‚úÖ (after proof submitted) | ‚ùå |
| Notify Citizen (Progress) | ‚úÖ (only during IN_PROGRESS) | ‚ùå |
| Notify Citizen (After Resolved) | ‚ùå (blocked until state verifies) | ‚úÖ |
| Verify & Close Complaint | ‚ùå | ‚úÖ |
| Assign Complaint | ‚ùå | ‚úÖ |

## API Endpoints

3. **Dashboard Data**: `GET /api/officer/state-dashboard`

## Notification Rules

### District Officer Notifications
- **Allowed**: During `IN_PROGRESS` or `ACKNOWLEDGED` status
- **Purpose**: Send progress updates to citizens
- **Restriction**: Cannot notify after marking as `RESOLVED`
- **Message**: Prefixed with "üì¢ Citizen Notification from [Officer Name] (Progress Update)"

### State Officer Notifications

- **Purpose**: Final notification about complaint closure
- **Restriction**: Should only notify when closing complaints

- Analytics (category breakdown, priority distribution, performance metrics)
- Complaint tabs: Pending, Acknowledged, In Progress, Resolved
- Action buttons based on complaint status
- Status indicators for resolved and closed complaints

**Status Messages**:

## Status Workflow Diagram

```
SUBMITTED (Citizen files complaint)
    ‚Üì
[State Officer assigns to District Officer]
    ‚Üì
IN_PROGRESS (District Officer acknowledges)
    ‚Üì
[District Officer can: Submit Proof, Notify Citizen, Continue Work]
    ‚Üì
RESOLVED (District Officer marks complete)
    ‚Üì
[State Officer reviews proof of work]
    ‚Üì
    ‚îú‚îÄ‚Üí CLOSED (State Officer approves) ‚Üê Final state, can notify citizen
    ‚îî‚îÄ‚Üí IN_PROGRESS (State Officer rejects) ‚Üê Back to district officer
```

## Key Business Rules

1. **District officers cannot close complaints** - Only state officers can set status to `CLOSED`
2. **District officers cannot notify after resolving** - Prevents premature completion notifications
3. **State officers must verify before closure** - Ensures quality control
4. **Proof of work is mandatory** - District officers should submit evidence before resolving
5. **Single source of truth** - Status field determines available actions, not derived flags
6. **Hierarchical approval** - Maintains chain of command (District ‚Üí State)

## Testing the Workflow

### Test Scenario 1: Normal Flow
1. Login as Amit Patel (District Officer) - `amit.patel@gov.in` / `password123`
2. Navigate to District Officer Dashboard
3. Find a SUBMITTED complaint in Pending tab
4. Click "‚úÖ Acknowledge & Start Work"
5. Click "üì∏ Submit Proof of Work" - Add description, work details, photos
6. Click "üì¢ Notify Citizen (Progress Update)" - Send progress message
7. Click "‚úîÔ∏è Mark as Resolved" - When work complete
8. Logout

9. Login as Rajesh Kumar (State Officer) - `rajesh.kumar@gov.in` / `password123`
10. Navigate to State Officer Dashboard
11. Find complaint in "Awaiting Verification" section
12. Click "Review & Verify" button
13. Review proof of work submitted
14. Add verification comments (optional)
15. Check "üì¢ Notify citizen upon closure" if desired
16. Add notification message
17. Click "‚úì Approve and Close Complaint"
18. Verify complaint is now CLOSED

### Test Scenario 2: Rejection Flow
Follow steps 1-8 from above, then:
9-12. Same as above
13. Add rejection comments
14. Click "‚úó Reject Resolution"
15. Verify complaint is back to IN_PROGRESS
16. District officer can see it again and rework

## Security Considerations

- **Token-based authentication**: All API routes require valid JWT Bearer token
- **Role validation**: Endpoints check userType (government_officer) and adminLevel (DISTRICT/STATE)
- **Assignment verification**: District officers can only act on complaints assigned to them
- **Status-based authorization**: Actions blocked if complaint not in appropriate status
- **State officer override**: Only state officers can verify and close complaints

## Database Models

### Complaint Schema
```typescript
status: ComplaintStatus (SUBMITTED | ACKNOWLEDGED | IN_PROGRESS | RESOLVED | CLOSED | REJECTED)
proofOfWork: [{
  description: string,
  workDetails: string,
  photos: string[],
  submittedBy: ObjectId,
  submittedAt: Date
}]
resolution: {
  resolvedAt: Date,
  resolvedBy: ObjectId,
  resolutionNotes: string,
  verifiedBy: ObjectId,
  verifiedAt: Date,
  verificationNotes: string,
  verificationRequired: boolean
}
statusHistory: [{
  status: ComplaintStatus,
  updatedBy: ObjectId,
  comments: string,
  updatedAt: Date
}]
```

## Future Enhancements

1. **Email/SMS Integration**: Real notifications instead of just status history
2. **Push Notifications**: Real-time updates for citizens and officers
3. **Escalation Timers**: Auto-escalate if not resolved within deadline
4. **Citizen Feedback**: Allow citizens to rate resolution quality
5. **Analytics Dashboard**: Track officer performance over time
6. **Attachment Management**: Better photo upload and storage system
7. **Mobile App**: Dedicated apps for citizens and officers
8. **Multi-language Support**: Notifications in regional languages

## Troubleshooting

### Issue: "Cannot notify citizen" error
**Cause**: District officer trying to notify after marking resolved
**Solution**: District officers can only notify during IN_PROGRESS status

### Issue: "Not authorized to close complaint" error
**Cause**: District officer trying to close complaint directly
**Solution**: Only state officers can close complaints after verification

### Issue: Buttons not showing
**Cause**: Status check logic incorrect
**Solution**: Verify complaint.status field matches expected values (lowercase)

### Issue: State officer can't see resolved complaints
**Cause**: API not returning resolved complaints
**Solution**: Check state-dashboard route includes resolvedComplaints query

## Contact & Support
