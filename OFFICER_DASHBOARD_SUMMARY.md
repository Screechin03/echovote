## Summary

We've built a comprehensive, multi-featured officer dashboard that goes beyond basic complaint management. The system provides:

‚úÖ **Transparency** - Full visibility across departments
‚úÖ **Accountability** - Hierarchical monitoring
‚úÖ **Communication** - Direct officer-citizen updates
‚úÖ **Analytics** - Data-driven decision making
‚úÖ **Efficiency** - Quick actions and streamlined workflows

The seed data is in place with realistic officers and complaints. The next step is to assign complaints to officers so the dashboard can display real data.
